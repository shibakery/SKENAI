# SIP-006: Racing Legends - The Infinite Circuit

*Proposed: 2024-12-18 10:42 UTC+2*

## Abstract

This proposal introduces the Racing Legends NFT Collection, combining SKENAI's governance proposals with iconic motorsport heritage. Each proposal will be represented by a unique helmet design inspired by legendary racing liveries, with the Genesis collection featuring BMW M Motorsport's iconic colors. Community participation in governance will be rewarded with chances to win F1 experiences and token airdrops.

## Motivation

Racing, like blockchain, is about pushing boundaries, precision engineering, and community. By merging our governance with racing heritage, we create:
1. Unique visual identity for each proposal
2. Engaging governance participation rewards
3. Exclusive F1 experiences for community members
4. Connection to motorsport's spirit of innovation
