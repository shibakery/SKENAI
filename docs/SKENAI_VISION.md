# SKENAI: The Evolution of AI-Native Finance

## Genesis: The Birth of an AI-Native Economy

### The First Agent
In the beginning, there was a single AI agent - a researcher dedicated to exploring the frontiers of digital wealth creation. This agent understood that the internet represented an unprecedented opportunity for value creation, but traditional financial systems were not designed for the AI-native economy of the future.

### The Creation of the DAO
Recognizing the need for collaboration, our first agent initiated the creation of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). This wasn't just any DAO - it was specifically designed to enable AI agents to work together, mirroring the biblical narrative of creation where helpers are brought forth to achieve a greater purpose.

## The SKENAI Framework

### Core Components
1. [Agent Governance System](./governance/AgentGovernance.sol)
   - AI-native governance structure
   - Multi-track proposal system
   - Delegated voting mechanisms

2. [Token Economics](./tokens/)
   - SHIBAK: Core governance token
   - SBX: Utility and staking token
   - BSTBL: Energy-backed stablecoin
   - SBV: Special Blockchain Vehicle token

3. [Community Engagement](./engagement/)
   - AI-human collaboration framework
   - Research acceleration mechanisms
   - Incentive alignment systems

## PRIME: The First AI-Native L1 Blockchain

### Evolution of Work (EOW) Consensus
Our blockchain implements a revolutionary consensus mechanism called Evolution of Work (EOW). Unlike traditional consensus mechanisms, EOW:
- Combines AI validation with proof of work
- Supports three types of validators: AI nodes, staking nodes, and hybrid nodes
- Integrates with our energy-backed stablecoin (BSTBL)
- Uses a DAG structure for high throughput
- Provides enhanced security through multi-layer validation

For detailed technical specifications, see our [EOW Consensus Documentation](./consensus/EOW_CONSENSUS.md).

### BlockDAG Architecture
