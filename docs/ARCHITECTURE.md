### The Infinite Circuit: Mycelial Performance Matrix

The SKENAI performance matrix adopts a mycelial structure, allowing for organic growth and interconnected relationships between proposals while maintaining the core 7-track framework.

#### Base Layer (Level 0)
The base layer consists of 42 fundamental proposals organized in a 6×7 matrix structure:

```
Performance Level (Y) ↗
     ┌──────────────────── Tracks (X) ────────────────────┐
     Genesis  Fractal  Options  Research  Community  Encyclic
 P   [000]     [ ]      [ ]      [ ]      [ ]        [ ]     ← Quantum
 e   [ ]      [001]     [ ]      [ ]      [ ]        [ ]     ← Orbital
 r   [ ]       [ ]     [002]     [ ]      [ ]        [ ]     ← Stellar
 f   [ ]       [ ]      [ ]     [003]     [ ]        [ ]     ← Pulsar
 o   [ ]       [ ]      [ ]      [ ]      [ ]        [ ]     ← Neutron
 r   [ ]       [ ]      [ ]      [ ]      [ ]        [ ]     ← Quasar
 m   [ ]       [ ]      [ ]      [ ]      [ ]        [ ]     ← Singularity
(Y)
```

Each position represents a unique proposal slot, with performance levels inspired by gravitational phenomena in physics, reflecting the increasing impact and influence of proposals as they move up the hierarchy:

1. **Quantum** - Entry level, fundamental proposals
2. **Orbital** - Established proposals with basic gravitational pull
3. **Stellar** - Proposals with significant community influence
4. **Pulsar** - High-energy proposals with periodic impact
5. **Neutron** - Dense, highly impactful proposals
6. **Quasar** - Proposals with massive reach and energy
7. **Singularity** - Ultimate proposal state with maximum influence

#### Fractal Depth Structure (Z-Axis)

Each position in the base matrix can spawn sub-proposals that extend along the Z-axis, creating a three-dimensional mycelial network:

```
Level 0 (Base Node)           [Primary Proposal]
                                     │
Level 1 (Sub-Proposals)    ┌────┬────┴────┬────┐
                          │    │         │    │
                       [Sub1][Sub2]    [Sub3][Sub4]
                          │    │         │    │
Level 2 (Dependencies)  ┌──┘  ┌─┴─┐   ┌──┘    └──┐
                       │     │   │   │          │
                    [Dep1] [Dep2] │  [Dep3]   [Dep4]
                                 └──── Cross-connections
```

#### Mycelial Properties

1. **Fractal Growth**
   - Each proposal can spawn N sub-proposals based on complexity
   - Sub-proposals inherit track characteristics while developing specializations
   - No artificial limits on depth or breadth of connections

2. **Cross-Connections**
   - Proposals can form connections across:
     * Different tracks
     * Different performance levels
     * Different depth levels
   - Connections strength is determined by:
     * Shared dependencies
     * Complementary objectives
     * Verification overlap

3. **Depth Mechanics**
   - Level 0: Primary proposals (7x7 matrix)
   - Level 1+: Supporting proposals with specialized focus
   - Cross-level connections: Enable resource and insight sharing

4. **Verification Propagation**
   - Verification flows bidirectionally through connections
   - Sub-proposal verification strengthens parent proposals
   - Cross-connections amplify verification confidence

This structure maintains the clarity of the 7-track system while enabling:
- Infinite scalability through fractal growth
- Organic development of proposal relationships
- AI agent autonomy in creating supporting structures
- Natural emergence of proposal ecosystems

   }
   ```

### Dynamic Progression

1. **Track Independence**
   - Each track progresses at its own pace
   - Cross-track bonuses still apply
   - No time constraints

2. **Performance Boosters**
   ```
   Boost = Base * (1 + Adjacent Track Levels)
   where:
   Base = Current performance
   Adjacent = Sum of connected track levels (Entry=1, Bronze=2, etc.)
   ```

3. **Catchup Mechanics**
   ```
   Support = Max(0, Average Track Level - Current Track Level) * Boost Multiplier
   where:
   Boost Multiplier increases with gap size
   ```

4. **Flexible Unlocks**
   - Core functionalities available at Entry level
   - Advanced features unlock with performance
   - Hidden features reveal based on combinations

### Risk Management

1. **Performance Verification**
   - On-chain metrics where possible
   - Oracle-based verification for off-chain
   - Community validation for subjective metrics

2. **Anti-Gaming Measures**
   ```
   True Progress = Measured Progress * (1 - Anomaly Factor)
   where:
   Anomaly Factor = Detected unusual patterns (0-0.5)
   ```

3. **Recovery Mechanics**
   - Performance level maintenance requirements
   - Grace periods for temporary drops
   - Recovery paths for lost levels
