# SKENAI Technical Architecture

## System Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **Agent Communication Layer**
   - Message Queue System for inter-agent communication
   - Event-driven architecture using Redis/RabbitMQ
   - Shared state management

2. **Data Pipeline**
   - Real-time market data ingestion
   - Social media feeds processing
   - Historical data storage and analysis

3. **Strategy Engine**
   - Backtesting framework
   - Strategy evaluation metrics
   - Risk management system

4. **Smart Contract Layer**
   - Liquidity pool management
   - DOV (DeFi Options Vault) contracts
   - DAO governance contracts

### Agent Implementation Priority

   - Integration with DEX APIs
   - DAO infrastructure

3. **S2 (Social Agent)**
   - Social media API integrations
   - Sentiment analysis engine
   - Community engagement automation
   - Intelligence gathering system

4. **S4 (Testing Agent)**
   - Automated testing framework
   - Security audit tools
   - Deployment pipeline
   - Performance monitoring
