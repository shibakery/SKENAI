# Boron-Backed Stablecoin (BRST) Proposal

## Executive Summary
This proposal introduces BRST (Boron Stable Token), a novel stablecoin pegged to the market value of Boron. Unlike traditional stablecoins, BRST maintains its $1.00 peg through supply adjustments based on real-world Boron market dynamics.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **BoronStable Contract**
   - ERC20-compliant stablecoin
   - Supply adjustment mechanism
   - Price stability controls
   - Integration with existing DAO infrastructure

2. **BoronOracle System**
   - Chainlink-powered market data feeds
   - Validator network for data verification
   - Historical data tracking
   - Market analytics

```

## Market Mechanics

### Supply Adjustment
- Supply increases when Boron demand exceeds supply
- Supply decreases when Boron supply exceeds demand
- Adjustments maintain $1.00 peg
- Built-in cooldown periods prevent manipulation

### Oracle System
- Multiple data sources for Boron market data
- Validator network for data verification
- Chainlink integration for reliable price feeds
- Historical data analysis for trend detection

## Economic Model

### Token Distribution
1. **Initial Supply**: 1,000,000 BRST
2. **Distribution**:
   - 40% - Market Operations
   - 30% - DAO Treasury
   - 20% - Validator Rewards
   - 10% - Development Fund

### Validator Economics
1. **Stake Requirements**:
   - Minimum Stake: 1,000 tokens
   - Lock Period: 30 days
   - Performance Bonds

2. **Rewards**:
   - Market Data Updates: 10 BRST
   - Accurate Validations: 5 BRST
   - Monthly Performance Bonus

## Integration with Existing Systems

### DAO Integration
1. **Governance**
   - Parameter adjustments through DAO voting
   - Oracle network management
   - Validator approval process

2. **Token System**
   - Compatible with existing rewards
   - Integrated with messaging platform
   - Cross-chain capabilities

### Security Measures
1. **Oracle Security**
   - Multiple data sources
   - Validator stake requirements
   - Manipulation protection
   - Emergency shutdown capability

2. **Smart Contract Security**
   - Access control system
   - Rate limiting
   - Circuit breakers
   - Upgrade mechanism
