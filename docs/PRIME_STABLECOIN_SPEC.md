# PRIME Blockchain Stablecoin Specification

## Overview
The PRIME blockchain implements a novel stablecoin mechanism that synthesizes the real-world value of Boron mining energy costs into a digital asset. This creates a unique value proposition where the token's stability is maintained through a combination of mining dynamics and supply adjustments.

## Core Principles

### 1. Energy-Value Correlation
The fundamental value of BSTBL is derived from the energy cost required to mine Boron:

```
TokenValue = (MiningEnergyCost + ExtractionCost) / GlobalBoronOutput
```

Where:
- MiningEnergyCost: Energy consumption in kWh per ton of Boron
- ExtractionCost: Additional processing costs per ton
- GlobalBoronOutput: Daily Boron production in metric tons

### 2. Supply Control Mechanism

#### Supply Adjustment Formula
```
SupplyDelta = CurrentSupply * (1 - (TargetPrice / CurrentPrice)) * DampingFactor

Where:
- TargetPrice = $1.00
- DampingFactor = 0.5 (reduces volatility)
- CurrentPrice = Market price from oracle
```

#### Rebase Conditions
```
if |CurrentPrice - TargetPrice| > DeviationThreshold:
    if CurrentPrice > TargetPrice:
        NewSupply = CurrentSupply + SupplyDelta
    else:
        NewSupply = CurrentSupply - SupplyDelta
```

### 3. Mining Integration

#### Mining Difficulty Adjustment
```
Difficulty = BaseTarget * (NetworkHashrate / TargetHashrate) * EnergyEfficiencyFactor

Where:
EnergyEfficiencyFactor = BoronMiningEnergy / BlockMiningEnergy
```

#### Block Reward Calculation
```
BlockReward = BaseReward * (CurrentDifficulty / BaseDifficulty) * MarketStabilityFactor

Where:
MarketStabilityFactor = 1 - |1 - (CurrentPrice / TargetPrice)|
```

## Stability Mechanisms

### 1. Price Stability
The system maintains price stability through three mechanisms:

1. **Supply Adjustments**
   ```
   PriceDeviation = |CurrentPrice - TargetPrice| / TargetPrice
   AdjustmentRatio = min(PriceDeviation * DampingFactor, MaxAdjustment)
   ```

2. **Mining Difficulty**
   ```
   DifficultyAdjustment = (TargetBlockTime / ActualBlockTime) * EnergyPriceRatio
   ```

3. **Market Operations**
   ```
   OperationSize = CurrentSupply * PriceDeviation * MarketDepthFactor
   ```

### 2. Energy Cost Integration

The system tracks energy costs through:

1. **Energy Price Oracle**
   ```
   EnergyIndex = Σ(RegionalEnergyPrice * ProductionWeight)
   ```

2. **Mining Efficiency**
   ```
   EfficiencyRatio = BoronEnergyPerTon / NetworkHashPower
   ```

## Token Economics

### 1. Initial Parameters
- Initial Supply: 1,000,000 BSTBL
- Target Price: $1.00
- Deviation Threshold: 5%
- Rebase Interval: 24 hours
- Mining Reward: Based on energy cost equivalence

### 2. Supply Control
```solidity
function calculateSupplyAdjustment(
    uint256 currentPrice,
    uint256 targetPrice,
    uint256 currentSupply
) public pure returns (uint256) {
    // Calculate price deviation
    int256 deviation = int256(currentPrice) - int256(targetPrice);
    
    // Calculate adjustment percentage (with dampening)
    int256 adjustmentRatio = (deviation * DAMPENING_FACTOR) / int256(targetPrice);
    
    // Calculate supply change
    return uint256(int256(currentSupply) * adjustmentRatio / PRECISION);
}
```

### 3. Mining Rewards
```solidity
function calculateMiningReward(
    uint256 difficulty,
    uint256 energyCost
) public pure returns (uint256) {
    return (BASE_REWARD * difficulty * energyCost) / (BASE_DIFFICULTY * BASE_ENERGY_COST);
}
```

## Market Operations

### 1. Price Discovery
The system uses a weighted average of:
- Mining energy costs
- Market trading prices
- Oracle price feeds

```
WeightedPrice = (
    EnergyPrice * 0.4 +
    MarketPrice * 0.4 +
    OraclePrice * 0.2
)
```

### 2. Supply Adjustments
Supply adjustments are triggered when:
1. Price deviates beyond threshold
2. Energy costs shift significantly
3. Mining difficulty changes substantially

## Security Measures

### 1. Oracle Security
- Multiple data sources for energy prices
- Weighted median for price calculations
- Minimum number of valid oracle responses

### 2. Mining Security
- Difficulty adjustment limits
- Energy cost verification
- Hash rate monitoring

### 3. Supply Control Security
- Maximum supply change per rebase
- Timelock on parameter changes
- Emergency pause mechanism

## Integration with PRIME Blockchain

### 1. Block Structure
```
Block {
    header: {
        parentHash: Hash,
        timestamp: uint256,
        difficulty: uint256,
        energyCost: uint256,
        nonce: uint256
    },
    transactions: Transaction[],
    energyProof: Proof
}
```

### 2. Consensus Mechanism
The consensus mechanism combines:
- Proof of Work (mining)
- Energy cost validation
- Price stability verification

### 3. Network Parameters
- Block Time: 30 seconds
- Difficulty Adjustment: Every 2016 blocks
- Energy Cost Update: Every 24 hours
- Price Feed Update: Every block

## Formulas and Calculations

### 1. Price Stability
```
PriceStability = 1 - |1 - (CurrentPrice / TargetPrice)|
```

### 2. Energy Cost Impact
```
EnergyCostImpact = (CurrentEnergyCost - BaseEnergyCost) / BaseEnergyCost
```

### 3. Mining Difficulty
```
NewDifficulty = CurrentDifficulty * (TargetBlockTime / AverageBlockTime) * EnergyFactor
```

### 4. Supply Adjustment Impact
```
SupplyImpact = (NewSupply - CurrentSupply) / CurrentSupply
```

### 2. Key Interfaces
```solidity
interface IEnergyOracle {
    function getEnergyPrice() external view returns (uint256);
    function validateEnergyProof(bytes memory proof) external returns (bool);
}

interface IStabilityControl {
    function adjustSupply(uint256 currentPrice) external returns (bool);
    function updateParameters(bytes memory params) external;
}
```

This specification provides the foundation for implementing the PRIME blockchain's stablecoin mechanism. The integration of energy costs with traditional stablecoin mechanics creates a unique value proposition that reflects real-world resource dynamics.
